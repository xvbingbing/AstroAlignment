According to v=rω， where ω is the same for all points on Earth, achieving a larger linear velocity requires establishing launch sites at locations with the largest radius of rotation. Since Earth rotates around its axis and the rotational radius decreases with increasing latitude, to maximize the linear velocity of rotation at launch, it is ideal to have the largest rotational radius, which is found at the Equator—the location with the lowest latitude. Therefore, the most ideal launch site would be at the Equator. Among the options, the city closest to the Equator is Hainan, so the correct choice is D: Hainan."

This magnitude number does not reflect the actual luminosity of the star itself, as it does not consider the distance of the star (a star with the same luminosity appears less bright to us when it is farther away), so we refer to this magnitude number as the apparent magnitude. Based on prolonged observation, the faintest stars visible to the naked eye are sixth-magnitude stars. From first to sixth magnitude, each step represents a difference of five magnitudes, and there is a 100-fold difference in brightness. Two stars that differ by one magnitude have a brightness difference of 2.512 times; the Sun's magnitude is set at -26.7, and the full moon has an approximate magnitude of -12.6. Generally, stars fainter than sixth magnitude require a telescope for observation; Absolute magnitude: This measures the brightness of a celestial body if it were moved to a distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years) from Earth. It reflects the actual luminosity of the celestial body;\nSaturn is a planet with a variable brightness between 0.8 and 1.2 magnitudes. Currently located in Virgo, it can be observed in the eastern sky before dawn, slightly brighter than Regulus, hence option A is incorrect; Polaris, also known as α UMi, has a magnitude of 2.02, making it the 50th brightest star in the sky (various star charts may show slight differences). Clearly, after comparison, it can be concluded that among these four stars, Polaris—α UMi is the faintest, hence option B is correct;\nArcturus, α Bootis, with a magnitude of 0.04, is the fifth brightest star in the sky, therefore option C is incorrect; Altair, or β Aquilae, with a magnitude of 0.76, is the twelfth brightest star in the sky, hence option D is incorrect;\nTherefore, the correct choice is: B"

If one of these planets happens to pass between Earth and the Sun, observers on Earth will see a black dot moving across the Sun's face for about an hour or more. This phenomenon is called a transit.\n\nAnswerA transit occurs when the Sun is obscured by a small, dark celestial body that must be positioned between the Sun and Earth. Clearly, from Earth, only Mercury and Venus transits can be observed, and the International Space Station, being located between the Sun and Earth, is also visible. Therefore, it is impossible to observe a Mars transit from Earth."

It is important to note that for the left circle, regardless of the change in longitude, the arc length corresponding to 1 degree of latitude is fixed; for the right circle, at lower latitudes, the arc length corresponding to 1 degree of longitude is larger than at higher latitudes.\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, this question should be considered in two parts:\n1. Along the meridian, how much distance does a change in 1 degree of latitude represent?\nFor simplicity in calculation, we consider the length of the equator as the circumference of Earth's circle, with R = 40000 km.\nTaking the Northern Hemisphere as an example, where latitude ranges from 0° to 90°， the arc length of the Northern Hemisphere is 40000 / 4 = 10000 km.\nThus, a change in latitude by 1° corresponds to a distance L = 10000 / 90 ≈ 111.11 km.\n2. Along the parallel, how much distance does a change in 1 degree of longitude represent?\nAlthough the distance corresponding to a change in 1 degree of longitude varies with different latitudes, using the above calculation method, one only needs to calculate the circumference of the Earth's cross-sectional circle at different latitudes to determine the distance corresponding to a change in 1 degree of longitude at those latitudes."

With a diameter of 2706.8 kilometers, Triton ranks as the seventh-largest satellite in the solar system and is the only one of Neptune's moons massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium. In terms of mass ratio to its primary planet, it is the second-largest satellite after the Moon in relation to Earth.

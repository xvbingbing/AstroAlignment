While it has a highly elliptical orbit, its average distance (semi-major axis) from the Sun is what makes it particularly notable. The average distance is a more reliable measure of an object's typical position in the solar system than either its perihelion (closest approach) or aphelion (farthest point). At approximately 13 billion kilometers from Earth as mentioned in the background knowledge, Sedna's orbit places it far beyond the Kuiper Belt, making its average distance from the Sun greater than other known solar system objects at the time of its discovery.

Even with excellent equipment, if the image is not properly focused, the resulting photograph will be blurry and lack detail. This is particularly important because the moon has many fine details like craters and mountain ranges that require precise focusing to capture clearly. While other factors like sensitivity, tracking, and aperture do play roles in astrophotography, without proper focus, these other settings become largely irrelevant as they cannot compensate for an out-of-focus image.

Generally speaking, below 6 times is considered high magnification, 6-10 times is medium magnification, and above 10 times is low magnification.", "choice": "Choice: B, Explanation: While magnification is important, aperture (the diameter of the objective lens or mirror) is actually the most crucial performance metric for astronomical telescopes. The aperture determines how much light the telescope can collect - larger apertures allow more light to enter, enabling the observation of fainter objects and providing better resolution. While the background knowledge discusses magnification ratios, it's worth noting that magnification can be adjusted through different eyepieces, but a telescope's light-gathering ability (determined by aperture) is fundamental and cannot be improved without increasing the aperture size.

Using proportional reasoning, if the Sun's full angular diameter (1800 arcseconds) corresponds to 1.4 million km, then for an Earth-sized object (12,742 km) on the Sun's surface, the angular size would be: (12,742/1,400,000) \u00d7 1800 \u2248 16.4 arcseconds.

As explained in the background knowledge, while the spacecraft moves forward at 0.5c for 2 minutes, the light from the first signal travels at c. The difference in distances traveled (\u2460 - \u2461) means that each subsequent signal only needs to travel the distance that light covers in 1 minute to catch up to the previous signal's position.

The key evidence came from the Cassini spacecraft's detection of significant amounts of hydrogen in the plumes erupting from Enceladus's south polar region. This hydrogen, combined with the confirmed presence of a subsurface ocean and other necessary chemical elements, suggests the potential for methanogenesis (a process used by some microorganisms on Earth). The plumes, which shoot through cracks in the moon's icy surface, allowed scientists to sample the ocean's chemistry without having to drill through the ice.

Objects moving slower relative to the Sun would be in stable orbits. The ecliptic plane is where most solar system objects orbit, and when Earth encounters these objects moving in similar orbits, their relative velocities are lowest.

First, using Wien's law, we know that temperature is inversely proportional to peak wavelength. Star A peaks at 500nm and Star B at 250nm, so TB/TA = 500/250 = 2, meaning Star B is twice as hot as Star A.

The elevation angle of the polar axis is too high, and the altitude of stars at culmination is too low, which results in an inverted image.", "choice": "Choice: B, Explanation: When a telescope's polar axis is set too low relative to the true celestial pole, it creates distinct tracking errors that vary with the star's position. For stars near the eastern horizon, the telescope's tracking will cause the star to drift northward in the field of view because the axis is pointing below the true pole. However, for stars near the southern horizon, the tracking error appears minimal in the north-south direction because the motion is mostly in the east-west direction at this position. This pattern of drift - significant northward drift for eastern objects but minimal north-south drift for southern objects - is a clear indicator that the polar axis is set too low. If the axis were too high, we would see the opposite effect, with southward drift for eastern objects. Therefore, the polar axis must be set too low to produce the observed tracking behavior."}, {"ID": "269", "Question": "The phenomenon of precession was first discovered by the ancient Greek Hipparchus, and it was also independently discovered in ancient China.

A star's \"apparent magnitude\" at a distance of 10 parsecs is -8, but at a distance of 1 million parsecs, which is an increase in distance by a factor of 100,000, the apparent magnitude would increase by 5 for each factor of 10 in distance and by 10 for each factor of 100. Therefore, the magnitude should increase by 25, making it approximately 17th magnitude.", "choice": "Choice: A, Explanation: Using the background knowledge provided, we can solve this step by step. The absolute magnitude is -8 (the star's apparent magnitude at 10 parsecs). The star is 1000 kpc away, which is 1,000,000 parsecs. This represents an increase in distance by a factor of 100,000 (from 10 pc to 1,000,000 pc). Since apparent magnitude increases by 5 for each factor of 10 in distance, and we have 5 factors of 10 (100,000 = 10^5), the magnitude will increase by 5 \u00d7 5 = 28 magnitudes.

Over the roughly 6,500 years between 4500 BC and now, the declination of Antares would have been different.\n6) The precession cycle is about 26,000 years, and this would have placed Antares at a significantly higher position in the sky during the Yangshao period.\n7) This shift would have made Antares visible at a maximum altitude between 46 to 65 degrees during that period.\n\nTherefore, option D (46 to 65 degrees) is the correct answer."}, {"ID": "294", "Question": "Which of the following scenarios is impossible to occur when a student observes the Chinese Space Station (CSS) passing overhead from the ground?", "A": "He observed the CSS rising in the southeast and setting in the northwest.", "B": "He observed 5 CSS transits throughout the night.", "C": "He discovered that CSS is brighter than Vega.", "D": "He observed CSS \"skimming\" past Polaris at a very close angular distance.", "Answer": "A", "Parse": "Explanation omitted", "choice": "Choice: D, Explanation: This scenario is impossible because the CSS orbits Earth at an inclination of approximately 41.5 degrees relative to the equator. This means the CSS's ground track never goes beyond 41.5 degrees north or south latitude. As Polaris (the North Star) is located very close to the celestial north pole at approximately 90 degrees declination, it would be impossible for the CSS to appear to pass close to Polaris from any viewing location.

While we don't have direct magnitude values for Zao Fu 1, Celestial Gate, or Corona Borealis Increase Seven in the background information, since Algol (option D) is listed and we know it's quite bright, and it's given as one of the options, we can deduce that Zao Fu 1 must be the faintest.

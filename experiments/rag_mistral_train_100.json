Jupiter represents the gas giant class: its equatorial radius is about 71,000 kilometers, 11 times that of Earth; its volume is 1,316 times that of Earth; its mass is 318 times that of Earth's.", "choice": " Choice: C, Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of an orbit. In our case, Europa orbits Jupiter, so we are dealing with a two-body problem.\n\n   First, let's convert the given distance and time into SI units for consistency: 4.22 \u00d7 10^5 km = 4.22 \u00d7 10^8 m (since 1 km = 10^3 m), and 1.77 days = 1.77 \u00d7 24 hours = 42.16 hours = 4.216 \u00d7 3600 seconds = 15,595,200 seconds.\n\n   Now we can rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the mass of Jupiter (M_J): M_J^(3/2) = (4\u03c0^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2), where G is the gravitational constant. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n   M_J^(3/2) = (4\u03c0^2 * (4.22 \u00d7 10^8)^3) / (6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 * (15,595,200)^2).\n\n   Solving this equation gives us the mass of Jupiter in terms of its orbital properties. However, to compare it with Earth's mass, we need to find the ratio of their masses: M_J / M_E = (M_J^(3/2))/(M_E^(3/2)).\n\n   Since we have already calculated M_J^(3/2), we only need to find M_E^(3/2). We know that the mass of Earth is approximately 5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg, so M_E^(3/2) = (5.97 \u00d7 10^24)^(3/2).\n\n   Now we can compare the two values and find the ratio: M_J / M_E = (M_J^(3/2))/(M_E^(3/2)). This ratio represents the number of times Jupiter's mass is greater than Earth's mass. Since we know that Jupiter has a mass 318 times that of Earth, our answer should be approximately 318.\n\n   However, since we are looking for an option from A, B, C, or D, let's round the result to the nearest multiple of 100: Choice: C, Explanation: Jupiter has a mass approximately 320 times that of Earth's."}, {"ID": "80", "Question": "Which celestial body is not a dwarf planet?", "A": "Ceres", "B": "Pluto", "C": "Eris", "D": "1992QB1", "Answer": "D", "Parse": "The five dwarf planets are as follows: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.", "choice": " Choice: D, Explanation: 1992QB1 is not a dwarf planet as it has not been classified as such.

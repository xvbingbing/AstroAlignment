As mentioned in the background knowledge, it specifically corresponds to the area from the waist to the tail of the Great Bear constellation and consists of seven bright stars (five second magnitude and two third magnitude stars) arranged in a ladle or dipper shape.

While it has a highly elliptical orbit, its average distance (semi-major axis) from the Sun is what makes it particularly notable. The average distance is a more reliable measure of an object's typical position in the solar system than either its perihelion (closest approach) or aphelion (farthest point). At approximately 13 billion kilometers from Earth as mentioned in the background knowledge, Sedna's orbit places it far beyond the Kuiper Belt, making its average distance from the Sun greater than other known solar system objects at the time of its discovery.

Even with excellent equipment, if the image is not properly focused, the resulting photograph will be blurry and lack detail. This is particularly important because the moon has many fine details like craters and mountain ranges that require precise focusing to capture clearly. While other factors like sensitivity, tracking, and aperture do play roles in astrophotography, without proper focus, these other settings become largely irrelevant as they cannot compensate for an out-of-focus image.

This matches with option C (Forty Thousand kilometers). This specific altitude is crucial because at this height, the satellite's orbital period exactly matches Earth's rotational period, allowing the satellite to appear stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth. The other options (200 km, 3,000 km, and 500,000 km) are either too low or too high to maintain a geostationary orbit.

Each telescope is marked with a magnification, such as 7*35, indicating that the lens is 7 times magnification and the objective lens diameter is 35 millimeters. Generally speaking, below 6 times is considered high magnification, 6-10 times is medium magnification, and above 10 times is low magnification.", "choice": "Choice: B, Explanation: While magnification is important, aperture (the diameter of the objective lens or mirror) is actually the most crucial performance metric for astronomical telescopes. The aperture determines how much light the telescope can collect - larger apertures allow more light to enter, enabling the observation of fainter objects and providing better resolution. While the background knowledge discusses magnification ratios, it's worth noting that magnification can be adjusted through different eyepieces, but a telescope's light-gathering ability (determined by aperture) is fundamental and cannot be improved without increasing the aperture size. Even a highly magnified image will be useless if the telescope cannot gather enough light to see the object clearly.

The northern polar cap is predominantly water ice, while the southern cap has a more permanent dry ice component. During the Martian winter, dry ice forms a seasonal layer on both poles, but during summer, much of the dry ice sublimates (turns directly from solid to gas), revealing the more permanent water ice beneath.

The cycle of 14 synodic months mentioned in the background knowledge refers to the complete cycle for the same exact perigee-full moon configuration to repeat, but there are multiple perigee points in the Moon's orbit, and the full moon can coincide with different perigee points throughout the year.

Therefore, over a period of 30 days, the total advancement in rising time is approximately 120 minutes, which is 2 hours. Based on this calculation, today the star should rise around 8 p.m. This phenomenon is due to our use of solar time for timing, while the length of a sidereal day is slightly shorter than a solar day.

This longer atmospheric path means that more of the sun's radiation gets scattered and absorbed by the atmosphere before reaching our eyes, making it less intense and safer to view. This is known as atmospheric extinction.

Since the azimuth angle is measured from the south point (0\u00b0) and increases clockwise, west corresponds to 270\u00b0. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon must be opposite to the Sun (approximately 180\u00b0 apart), and since the Sun rises in the east (90\u00b0) at 6:00 AM, the Moon must be in the west (270\u00b0).

Using proportional reasoning, if the Sun's full angular diameter (1800 arcseconds) corresponds to 1.4 million km, then for an Earth-sized object (12,742 km) on the Sun's surface, the angular size would be: (12,742/1,400,000) \u00d7 1800 \u2248 16.4 arcseconds.

As explained in the background knowledge, while the spacecraft moves forward at 0.5c for 2 minutes, the light from the first signal travels at c. The difference in distances traveled (\u2460 - \u2461) means that each subsequent signal only needs to travel the distance that light covers in 1 minute to catch up to the previous signal's position.

While time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, it's more accurately described as a measurement of change within our three-dimensional space rather than a spatial dimension itself. We can move freely through the three spatial dimensions, but we cannot freely navigate through time like we can through space.

Shanghai is located at approximately 31\u00b0N latitude, while the northeastern region of China is at a higher latitude (typically around 40-50\u00b0N).

For example, if someone crosses the line from west to east on Monday at 3:00 PM, they will arrive at their destination where it's Tuesday at 3:00 PM.

This occurs because as the moon emerges from Earth's shadow during the end of a lunar eclipse, the sunlight first reaches the upper portion of the moon's surface. The azimuth angle of 90\u00b0 means we're observing the moon from a consistent viewing position, and the illumination pattern matches what we see during the waning gibbous phase, where the upper portion of the moon is illuminated.

Jupiter represents the gas giant class: its equatorial radius is about 71,000 kilometers, 11 times that of Earth; its volume is 1,316 times that of Earth; its mass is 318 times that of Earth's.", "choice": " Choice: C, Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of an orbit. In our case, Europa orbits Jupiter, so we are dealing with a two-body problem.\n\n   First, let's convert the given distance and time into SI units for consistency: 4.22 \u00d7 10^5 km = 4.22 \u00d7 10^8 m (since 1 km = 10^3 m), and 1.77 days = 1.77 \u00d7 24 hours = 42.16 hours = 4.216 \u00d7 3600 seconds = 15,595,200 seconds.\n\n   Now we can rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the mass of Jupiter (M_J): M_J^(3/2) = (4\u03c0^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2), where G is the gravitational constant. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n   M_J^(3/2) = (4\u03c0^2 * (4.22 \u00d7 10^8)^3) / (6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 * (15,595,200)^2).\n\n   Solving this equation gives us the mass of Jupiter in terms of its orbital properties. However, to compare it with Earth's mass, we need to find the ratio of their masses: M_J / M_E = (M_J^(3/2))/(M_E^(3/2)).\n\n   Since we have already calculated M_J^(3/2), we only need to find M_E^(3/2). We know that the mass of Earth is approximately 5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg, so M_E^(3/2) = (5.97 \u00d7 10^24)^(3/2).\n\n   Now we can compare the two values and find the ratio: M_J / M_E = (M_J^(3/2))/(M_E^(3/2)). This ratio represents the number of times Jupiter's mass is greater than Earth's mass. Since we know that Jupiter has a mass 318 times that of Earth, our answer should be approximately 318.\n\n   However, since we are looking for an option from A, B, C, or D, let's round the result to the nearest multiple of 100: Choice: C, Explanation: Jupiter has a mass approximately 320 times that of Earth's."}, {"ID": "80", "Question": "Which celestial body is not a dwarf planet?", "A": "Ceres", "B": "Pluto", "C": "Eris", "D": "1992QB1", "Answer": "D", "Parse": "The five dwarf planets are as follows: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.", "choice": " Choice: D, Explanation: 1992QB1 is not a dwarf planet as it has not been classified as such.

Assuming the structure of the star itself remains unchanged, this would require the distance to become $\\sqrt{158.5}\\approx12.6$ times smaller, which is equivalent to reducing the distance by 3.91 light-years, translating to approximately 54,000 years. Therefore, option B is selected.", "choice": " Choice: B, Explanation: Given that Proxima Centauri is currently at an apparent magnitude of 11.5 and we know that a reduction of 5.5 magnitudes corresponds to an increase in brightness by approximately 158.5 times (as per the background knowledge), we can calculate the new apparent magnitude when it becomes visible to the naked eye (approximately magnitude 6). To do this, we subtract 5.5 from the current magnitude of Proxima Centauri, which gives us a new magnitude of about -5.0. Using the inverse of the relationship between magnitude and brightness, we find that the new brightness is approximately $100^{\\frac{5}{5}}=10^1=10$ times brighter than its current brightness. Since the distance remains unchanged, the only way for the brightness to increase by a factor of 10 is if the star's luminosity increases by the same factor. However, since we are assuming that the structure of the star itself remains unchanged, this means that the star must be approaching us and becoming closer. In order for Proxima Centauri to approach us enough to become visible to the naked eye, it needs to reduce its distance by a factor of $\\sqrt{10}\\approx3.2$ times (as per the background knowledge). Since the current distance is 4.243 light-years, we can calculate the new distance as $4.243\\times(1/3.2)\\approx13.25$ light-years. Now, using the speed provided in the question (21.7 km/s), we can find the time it takes for Proxima Centauri to approach us by this distance: $13.25\\text{ light-years}/21.7\\text{ km/s}\\approx60,849\\text{ years}$.

Since the Moon's actual angular size is 0.5\u00b0, an eyepiece that provides a field of view of 40\u00b0 will allow the entire Moon to fill the field of view. Therefore, we need an eyepiece with a 40\u00b0 field of view. To find the focal length of this eyepiece, we can use the magnification formula: Magnification = Objective Lens Focal Length / Eyepiece Focal Length. We know that the Moon fills the field of view at around 80 times, so the eyepiece's focal length should be approximately 900mm/80 = 11.25mm.

Since magnitude 2 is brighter than magnitude 2.0, these 14 second-magnitude stars also fall under the category of stars of magnitude 2 or brighter. Therefore, the total number of such stars that can be observed from Earth when occulted by the Moon is 4 (first-magnitude) + 14 (second-magnitude) = 18 + 4 = 22. However, since only stars with an ecliptic latitude less than 6.5\u00b0 have a chance of being occulted, we need to subtract the stars that are outside this range from our total. Unfortunately, without specific information about the ecliptic latitudes of these 18 second-magnitude stars, we cannot determine exactly how many of them will be occulted. However, since there are only 4 first-magnitude stars with a chance of being occulted, it is likely that not all 18 second-magnitude stars will be occulted. Therefore, the final answer should be less than 22 but more than 4. Since we cannot determine an exact number without further information, the closest multiple of 4 greater than 4 and less than 22 is 8. However, this is not one of the given choices. The closest choice from the given options would be C:18, but since we know that not all second-magnitude stars will be occulted, this answer is incorrect.

(Known: solar luminosity 3.8\u00d7 10^26W, electron mass 9.1\u00d710^-31kg, proton mass 1.7\u00d710^-27kg.)", "A": "1:5", "B": "2:5", "C": "1:50", "D": "2:50", "Answer": "A", "Parse": "Explanation omitted", "choice": " Choice: A, Explanation: To find the ratio of mass loss rates, we first need to calculate the mass carried away by each particle in the solar wind and compare it with the mass consumed per second due to nuclear fusion. The mass carried away by a single proton (or electron) in the solar wind is their respective masses. However, since there are approximately 6 electrons for every proton in the Sun, we can consider the mass of 6 electrons as negligible compared to that of a proton. So, we'll focus on the protons.\n\nThe number of protons blown out per second is n = 1 \u00d7 10^36. The total mass loss rate due to solar wind is then (n * proton mass) = (1 \u00d7 10^36 * 1.7 \u00d7 10^-27 kg) = 1.7 \u00d7 10^9 kg/s.\n\nThe energy produced per second by the Sun through nuclear fusion is its luminosity, which is given as 3.8\u00d7 10^26 W. The mass equivalent of this energy can be calculated using E=mc^2, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s). So, the mass consumed per second due to nuclear fusion is (energy / c^2) = (3.8 \u00d7 10^26 J / (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)^2) = 1.3 \u00d7 10^9 kg/s.\n\nThe ratio of the mass loss rate of the solar wind to that of nuclear fusion is then approximately 1.7 \u00d7 10^9 kg/s / 1.3 \u00d7 10^9 kg/s = 1.3 (rounded to two decimal places).

Since a factor of 10 in distance increases the magnitude by 5, and this star is 10^6 times further than 10 parsecs, it will increase the magnitude by 6*5 = 30. However, since the star is a supergiant, its brightness decreases as we move away from it, so we need to add an additional 25 (as per the background knowledge) for the increased distance. Therefore, the total increase in magnitude would be 30 + 25 = 55. Since the original magnitude was -8, subtracting 55 from it gives us an apparent magnitude of approximately 55 - (-8) = 63, which is equivalent to 10th magnitude (as the smallest whole number close to 63 is 10).

Option (A) is known as the flatness problem. According to the Friedmann equations, any deviation from flatness |\u03a9 - 1| will grow rapidly over time as the universe expands. Therefore, to obtain the flat universe we observe today (|\u03a9 - 1| \u2248 0.01), the early universe must have been extremely flat (up to 18 decimal points at t = 1 second), which is an extraordinarily fine-tuned initial condition. Inflation would quickly flatten the universe, thereby solving this issue. Option (B) is known as the horizon problem. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) we observe today is very uniform in all directions, indicating that the universe was in thermal equilibrium during the recombination era (when CMB radiation was released). However, traditional Big Bang theory predicts that the horizon distance was much smaller than the last scattering surface (i.e., there was not enough time for light to travel between opposite points on the CMB), so such thermal equilibrium should have been impossible. Inflation theory solves this because the universe could have been in thermal equilibrium before inflation. Then, rapid expansion during inflation would create a universe that is uniform in temperature regardless of the horizon distance at recombination. Option (C) is the monopole problem. Grand unified theories predict that magnetic monopoles should have existed in the early universe (perhaps one per cubic horizon distance). Not only have no monopoles been discovered, but traditional Big Bang theory actually predicts so many monopoles that the density parameter \u03a9 would exceed 10^20! However, if monopoles formed before inflation, their density would decrease exponentially, making them undetectable today. These three options are the three main problems with the traditional Big Bang theory, prompting cosmologists to supplement it with inflation theory.", "choice": " Choice: A, Explanation: Inflation theory can explain why our universe could be flat or almost flat, as it quickly flattens the universe, solving the flatness problem."}, {"ID": "309", "Question": "HD 209458b has a radius that is 1.35 times that of Jupiter, while the radius of HD 209458 is 1.2 times that of the Sun.

In this context, it refers to a specific celestial object, likely a supernova remnant or a planetary nebula, which is associated with the Ghost constellation. The description of the star as being \"vigorously entering the Ghost by one and a half degrees\" suggests that it is moving quickly towards the Ghost constellation. Additionally, the location given (sixty-nine degrees from the pole, and twenty-two degrees within the ecliptic) corresponds to Messier 45 (M45), also known as the Pleiades star cluster. However, it's important to note that the term \"accumulated corpse gas\" is not directly associated with any specific Messier object, but rather refers to a type of celestial object that undergoes certain processes related to stellar evolution, such as supernovae or planetary nebulae. Therefore, while M45 fits the location and constellation description, it does not perfectly match the term \"accumulated corpse gas\". However, without additional context or information, it is reasonable to assume that the object being referred to in this passage is likely Messier 45 (M45)."}, {"ID": "397", "Question": "What is the maximum distance that Comet 17P/Holmes can reach, given its semi-major axis of approximately 3.6 AU and a perihelion distance of about 2.0 AU?", "A": "Asteroid Belt", "B": "Oort Cloud", "C": "Kuiper Belt", "D": "Jupiter's Orbit", "Answer": "D", "Parse": "The orbital semi-major axis of Comet 17P/Holmes is about 3.6 AU, with a perihelion distance of approximately 2.0 AU.

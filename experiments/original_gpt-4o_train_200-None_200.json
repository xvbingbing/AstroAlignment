Option (A) is known as the flatness problem. According to the Friedmann equations, any deviation from flatness |\u03a9 - 1| will grow rapidly over time as the universe expands. Therefore, to obtain the flat universe we observe today (|\u03a9 - 1| \u2248 0.01), the early universe must have been extremely flat (up to 18 decimal points at t = 1 second), which is an extraordinarily fine-tuned initial condition. Inflation would quickly flatten the universe, thereby solving this issue. Option (B) is known as the horizon problem. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) we observe today is very uniform in all directions, indicating that the universe was in thermal equilibrium during the recombination era (when CMB radiation was released). However, traditional Big Bang theory predicts that the horizon distance was much smaller than the last scattering surface (i.e., there was not enough time for light to travel between opposite points on the CMB), so such thermal equilibrium should have been impossible. Inflation theory solves this because the universe could have been in thermal equilibrium before inflation. Then, rapid expansion during inflation would create a universe that is uniform in temperature regardless of the horizon distance at recombination. Option (C) is the monopole problem. Grand unified theories predict that magnetic monopoles should have existed in the early universe (perhaps one per cubic horizon distance). Not only have no monopoles been discovered, but traditional Big Bang theory actually predicts so many monopoles that the density parameter \u03a9 would exceed 10^20! However, if monopoles formed before inflation, their density would decrease exponentially, making them undetectable today. These three options are the three main problems with the traditional Big Bang theory, prompting cosmologists to supplement it with inflation theory.", "choice": "D"}, {"ID": "309", "Question": "HD 209458b has a radius that is 1.35 times that of Jupiter, while the radius of HD 209458 is 1.2 times that of the Sun.

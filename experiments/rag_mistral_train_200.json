Jupiter represents the gas giant class: its equatorial radius is about 71,000 kilometers, 11 times that of Earth; its volume is 1,316 times that of Earth; its mass is 318 times that of Earth's.", "choice": " Choice: C, Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of an orbit. In our case, Europa orbits Jupiter, so we are dealing with a two-body problem.\n\n   First, let's convert the given distance and time into SI units for consistency: 4.22 \u00d7 10^5 km = 4.22 \u00d7 10^8 m (since 1 km = 10^3 m), and 1.77 days = 1.77 \u00d7 24 hours = 42.16 hours = 4.216 \u00d7 3600 seconds = 15,595,200 seconds.\n\n   Now we can rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the mass of Jupiter (M_J): M_J^(3/2) = (4\u03c0^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2), where G is the gravitational constant. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n   M_J^(3/2) = (4\u03c0^2 * (4.22 \u00d7 10^8)^3) / (6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 * (15,595,200)^2).\n\n   Solving this equation gives us the mass of Jupiter in terms of its orbital properties. However, to compare it with Earth's mass, we need to find the ratio of their masses: M_J / M_E = (M_J^(3/2))/(M_E^(3/2)).\n\n   Since we have already calculated M_J^(3/2), we only need to find M_E^(3/2). We know that the mass of Earth is approximately 5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg, so M_E^(3/2) = (5.97 \u00d7 10^24)^(3/2).\n\n   Now we can compare the two values and find the ratio: M_J / M_E = (M_J^(3/2))/(M_E^(3/2)). This ratio represents the number of times Jupiter's mass is greater than Earth's mass. Since we know that Jupiter has a mass 318 times that of Earth, our answer should be approximately 318.\n\n   However, since we are looking for an option from A, B, C, or D, let's round the result to the nearest multiple of 100: Choice: C, Explanation: Jupiter has a mass approximately 320 times that of Earth's."}, {"ID": "80", "Question": "Which celestial body is not a dwarf planet?", "A": "Ceres", "B": "Pluto", "C": "Eris", "D": "1992QB1", "Answer": "D", "Parse": "The five dwarf planets are as follows: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.", "choice": " Choice: D, Explanation: 1992QB1 is not a dwarf planet as it has not been classified as such.

Assuming the structure of the star itself remains unchanged, this would require the distance to become $\\sqrt{158.5}\\approx12.6$ times smaller, which is equivalent to reducing the distance by 3.91 light-years, translating to approximately 54,000 years. Therefore, option B is selected.", "choice": " Choice: B, Explanation: Given that Proxima Centauri is currently at an apparent magnitude of 11.5 and we know that a reduction of 5.5 magnitudes corresponds to an increase in brightness by approximately 158.5 times (as per the background knowledge), we can calculate the new apparent magnitude when it becomes visible to the naked eye (approximately magnitude 6). To do this, we subtract 5.5 from the current magnitude of Proxima Centauri, which gives us a new magnitude of about -5.0. Using the inverse of the relationship between magnitude and brightness, we find that the new brightness is approximately $100^{\\frac{5}{5}}=10^1=10$ times brighter than its current brightness. Since the distance remains unchanged, the only way for the brightness to increase by a factor of 10 is if the star's luminosity increases by the same factor. However, since we are assuming that the structure of the star itself remains unchanged, this means that the star must be approaching us and becoming closer. In order for Proxima Centauri to approach us enough to become visible to the naked eye, it needs to reduce its distance by a factor of $\\sqrt{10}\\approx3.2$ times (as per the background knowledge). Since the current distance is 4.243 light-years, we can calculate the new distance as $4.243\\times(1/3.2)\\approx13.25$ light-years. Now, using the speed provided in the question (21.7 km/s), we can find the time it takes for Proxima Centauri to approach us by this distance: $13.25\\text{ light-years}/21.7\\text{ km/s}\\approx60,849\\text{ years}$.

Since the Moon's actual angular size is 0.5\u00b0, an eyepiece that provides a field of view of 40\u00b0 will allow the entire Moon to fill the field of view. Therefore, we need an eyepiece with a 40\u00b0 field of view. To find the focal length of this eyepiece, we can use the magnification formula: Magnification = Objective Lens Focal Length / Eyepiece Focal Length. We know that the Moon fills the field of view at around 80 times, so the eyepiece's focal length should be approximately 900mm/80 = 11.25mm.

Among these stars, there are four first-magnitude stars, including Regulus, Spica, Antares, and Pollux. The other fourteen second-magnitude stars can be found in the seasonal star charts.", "choice": " Choice: D, Explanation: According to the background knowledge provided, there are 4 first-magnitude stars (Regulus, Spica, Antares, and Pollux) that have a chance of being occulted by the Moon, and there are 14 second-magnitude stars. Since magnitude 2 is brighter than magnitude 2.0, these 14 second-magnitude stars also fall under the category of stars of magnitude 2 or brighter. Therefore, the total number of such stars that can be observed from Earth when occulted by the Moon is 4 (first-magnitude) + 14 (second-magnitude) = 18 + 4 = 22. However, since only stars with an ecliptic latitude less than 6.5\u00b0 have a chance of being occulted, we need to subtract the stars that are outside this range from our total. Unfortunately, without specific information about the ecliptic latitudes of these 18 second-magnitude stars, we cannot determine exactly how many of them will be occulted. However, since there are only 4 first-magnitude stars with a chance of being occulted, it is likely that not all 18 second-magnitude stars will be occulted. Therefore, the final answer should be less than 22 but more than 4. Since we cannot determine an exact number without further information, the closest multiple of 4 greater than 4 and less than 22 is 8. However, this is not one of the given choices. The closest choice from the given options would be C:18, but since we know that not all second-magnitude stars will be occulted, this answer is incorrect.

Currently, scientists can only observe half of this mysterious asteroid, so aside from its size, they are unable to determine its specific mass and composition, thereby making it impossible to accurately predict its future orbit.", "choice": "Choice: A, Explanation: The background knowledge states that an asteroid named \"2011AG5\" has a 1/625 chance of hitting Earth in February 2040. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 2011 AG5."}, {"ID": "99", "Question": "What kind of astronomical phenomenon corresponds to the \"new moon holding the old moon\"?", "A": "Earthshine", "B": "Insolation", "C": "Zodiacal Light", "D": "Penumbral Lunar Eclipse", "Answer": "A", "Parse": "Earthshine. The so-called \"new moon\" or \"old moon\" refers to the phenomenon where, during a new moon, the unilluminated portion of the Moon is not completely dark. This is due to the reflection of Earth's light, which allows us to see the shadowed part of the Moon.", "choice": "Choice: A, Explanation: The phenomenon described as \"new moon holding the old moon\" refers to Earthshine. During a new moon, when the Moon is not fully illuminated by the Sun, we can still see a faint glow on the darkened portion of the Moon's surface due to sunlight reflecting off the Earth and back onto the Moon. This effect is known as Earthshine and matches the description given in the question."}, {"ID": "100", "Question": "When Venus is at its greatest western elongation, the approximate time it sets below the horizon is", "A": "Morning", "B": "Afternoon", "C": "First half of the night", "D": "Late Night", "Answer": "B", "Parse": "The greatest western elongation of Venus refers to the time when Venus is at its farthest point from the Sun in the west.", "choice": "Choice: A, Explanation: When Venus is at its greatest western elongation, it appears in the western sky after sunset. Therefore, it sets below the horizon in the evening, around morning time when viewed from Earth."}, {"ID": "101", "Question": "If the length of a sidereal month were twice its present value, what would be the length of a synodic month?", "A": "59.06 days", "B": "65.38 days", "C": "56.85 days", "D": "68.35 days", "Answer": "B", "Parse": "Explanation omitted", "choice": "Choice: D, Explanation: The relationship between the sidereal month (S) and the synodic month (Y) is given by the formula \\( \\frac{1}{Y} = \\frac{1}{S} - \\frac{1}{P} \\), where P is the length of a tropical year. If the sidereal month were twice its present value, let's denote the new sidereal month as \\( S' = 2S \\). The formula then becomes \\( \\frac{1}{Y'} = \\frac{1}{2S} - \\frac{1}{P} \\).\n\nGiven that a synodic month is approximately 29.53 days, and knowing the length of a tropical year (P) is about 365.25 days, we can substitute these values into the equation to find \\( Y' \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{Y'} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 27.32} - \\frac{1}{365.25} \\approx \\frac{1}{54.64} - \\frac{1}{365.25} \\approx 0.0183 - 0.0027 = 0.0156 \\]\n\n\\[ Y' \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0156} \\approx 64.1 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is D: 68.35 days, which might be due to rounding or approximation differences in the given values and options."}]

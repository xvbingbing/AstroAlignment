[{"ID": "1", "Question": "\"Big Dipper\" is ( )", "A": "A constellation", "B": "A part of a constellation", "C": "Consists of parts from several constellations.", "D": "A star cluster formed by the aggregation of multiple stars.", "Answer": "B", "Parse": "The Big Dipper is part of the Ursa Major constellation, consisting of five bright second magnitude stars and two third magnitude stars arranged in a ladle shape, similar to the ancient wine vessel known as a \"dou,\" hence its name. It is called the Big Dipper to distinguish it from the similarly shaped but lower-hanging six stars of the Southern Dipper in the Sagittarius constellation during the summer night sky. The Big Dipper corresponds to the area from the waist to the tail of the Great Bear constellation. Four of its stars form the ladle, while the other three make up the handle.", "choice": " Choice: B, Explanation: The Big Dipper is part of the Ursa Major constellation, not the entire constellation itself. It consists of five bright second magnitude stars and two third magnitude stars arranged in a ladle shape within the larger Ursa Major constellation."}, {"ID": "2", "Question": "1st magnitude stars appear brighter than 6th magnitude stars.", "A": "Same brightness", "B": "Brighter", "C": "much darker", "D": "Much larger", "Answer": "B", "Parse": "A first-magnitude star is a hundred times brighter than one of the sixth magnitude. Magnitudes are a way astronomers have of expressing the brightness of stars, so that the smaller the figure, the brighter the star, and each magnitude difference represents a ratio of about 2.5 in brightness. Sixth-magnitude stars are the faintest visible. There are 20 stars of the first magnitude, 46 of the second, 134 of the third, 458 of the fourth, 1,476 of the fifth, and 4,840 of the sixth, making a total of 6,974.", "choice": " Choice: A, Explanation: First-magnitude stars appear brighter than sixth-magnitude stars because each magnitude difference represents a ratio of about 2.5 in brightness, and a first-magnitude star is approximately 100 times brighter than a sixth-magnitude star."}]
